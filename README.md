# Stop and Search

A prototype built as part of a project with Black Thrive Global on presenting UK stop and search data and exploring racial disparities in the use of stop and search by the UK police.

The original prototype was taken from another [mySociety project](https://github.com/mysociety/local-intelligence-hub/tree/prototype).

## Use it online

Visit <https://mysociety.github.io/stop-and-search>.

All modern browsers are supported. Internet Explorer is not. See `.browserlistrc` for details.

## Running locally

Requirements:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/#getting-started)

Install all dependencies and get a local server running immediately, in one command:

    script/server

The site will be available at both <http://localhost:4000> and <http://0.0.0.0:4000>.

If you want to serve locally over SSL (recommended) then generate self-signed SSL certificates with:

    script/generate-ssl-certificates

Once the SSL certificates are in place, `script/server` will serve the site over HTTPS, at both <https://localhost:4000> and <https://0.0.0.0:4000>. (You will need to tell your web browser to accept the self-signed certificate.)

You can build the site to `_site` (without serving it) with:

    script/build
